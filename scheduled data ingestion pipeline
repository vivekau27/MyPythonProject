Scheduled data pipeline, which could load this data daily:

We can consider for example a scenerio where we are getting these file on S3 location. We can implement daily scheduled jobs(DAGs) using Airflow , where we would 
have file watcher jobs with defined timeout and retrys.
The file watches jobs will fetch files each day and put them in separate incoming location with year/month/day dir structure.
After file copy we can have a file to check to see if the file recieved for that day is a zero byte file or it has some data. Based on this either we would proceed
with the ingestion process or skip it for that day.


Data Profiling/Quality checks:
NULL/Empty Value Checks
Summary of Numeric Columns
Distinct Values for Columns of Interest
Validity of data for Columns of Interest(example date_of_birth/year/ etc.)

In ingestion we can implement an architecture where we load the raw data into a raw layer partitioned on date.
After which the Data from raw layer will be taken and we would put some data quality checks on it , this would also be a time to validate mandatory data quality
checks filteration etc.
After which the data will be staged temorarliy in a staging layer.

Data in staging layer would be compared to target  table where we would be using merge to implement CDC.
